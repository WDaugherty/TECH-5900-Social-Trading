# TECH-5900-Social-Trading

Team 7's main repository for solving **how might we use social media to predict market changes and inform trading decisions**

## Exploring the financial trading industry

To start tackling our HMW, we started by exploring the problem space and understand the current innerworkings of the financial industry. We approached this challenge through two angles:
1. Interviewing potential users on their trading habit and social media uses
2. Researching and building the rich picture to include all relevant stakeholders in the industry

### Interviewing potential users

We identified our target market and interviewed **14 participants** with a total time of **284 minutes**
