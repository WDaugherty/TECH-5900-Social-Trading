# TECH-5900-Social-Trading

Team 7's main repository for solving **how might we use social media to predict market changes and inform trading decisions**

## Exploring the financial trading industry

To start tackling our HMW, we started by exploring the problem space and understand the current innerworkings of the financial industry. We approached this challenge through two angles:
1. Interviewing potential users on their trading habit and social media uses
2. Researching and building the rich picture to include all relevant stakeholders in the industry

### Interviewing potential users

We accumulated **284 minutes** of interview time with **14 participants** and we discovered the following problem statements:
- Users find that there are an overwhelming amount of news distributed via social media sites
- Users find it difficult to connect these news with their personal conviction towards a company stock
- Users find that the process of digesting news via social media is not personalized and therefore takes a lot of time to do

### Creating the Rich Picture

Here is the overview of the financial trading landscape

## Ideation and Refinement

From these problem statements, we explored in total **100 different ideas** and used the [Darwinator](http://darwinator.com/) framework to select the top 3 ideas to move forward into the experiment stage. For each of these ideas, we devised 3 methods of experiments that will help to validate their problem-solution and product-market fits respectively.

By combining feedback from our coach and the Critters, we decided to choose **Earnie** - an AI-generated newsletter to help users digest financial news easily by aggregating multiple media sources and summarizing them through an NLP engine. Earnie helps to summarize the vast amount of information found in social media and package them into a simple newsletter format.

## Experimentations

To validate these value propositions, we conducted 3 independent experiments with 38 individuals as follows:

1. To measure whether users find value in using Earnie, we test users’ intention to buy a certain stock before and after providing them with a market summary
2. To measure customers’ preference in using Earnie over competing products, we conducted a blind comparison with two articles of the same topic and asked the users to pick which one they prefer
3. To measure whether users value a personalization feature, we conducted a parallel experiment to test users’ response on a curated newsletter and a non-curated version.

From these experiments, we concluded that users find value and prefer Earnie over competing products such as Robinhood and Motley Fool. However, users do not have a strong preference for the personalization feature of Earnie.
